      "content": "Jund represents a hugely flexible and powerful deck, which can potentially beat any opponent, if the deck is well tuned. Because of its flexible nature, the deck can be tuned to fit in any almost any meta, which makes Jund always an excellent deck choice. Jund utilizes the most powerful and valuable spells of the format, each of all bursting with strength on their own. It combines the most effective disruption spells backed up by the most effecient removal spells with its characteristic powerful threats, which represents the perfect mix of tools to beat any opponent. Because of this, it basically has potentially at least a 50:50 winrate against any deck. This doesn't seem like a big deal, however, it basically means that there are nearly no bad matchups for Jund, a few good ones and it has at least a good chance against the rest of the field. This is a probability, which doesn't occur often in modern decks. Additionally, matchups get significantly easier after game 1 as there are very few ways to directly sideboard against Jund while Jund has access to three very strong sideboard colors that offer access to some devastating cards against all decks in the format.",
